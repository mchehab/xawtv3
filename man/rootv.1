.TH rootv 1 "(c) 2000 Gerd Knorr"
.SH NAME
rootv - display TV/video as root window background 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rootv [ -stop | -wm ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B rootv
puts a video to the root window of your display.  Requires the Xvideo
extention.  If started with -stop the video will be stopped.
.P
rootv itself provides no way to control video/audio/tuner.  You can
use v4lctl to do this.  You can stick v4lctl calls into your window
manager menus for example.  "rootv -wm" will build a WindowMaker
menu with all TV stations from the ~/.xawtv config file.
