This is a very first version of bttv with the new i2c code.  Work in
progress, plenty of known bugs, pre-alpha quality.  No msp3400 support
yet, only the tuner works.  You should know what you are doing if you
want to play with it.  Tested only with 2.1.x

You should use the update script to load/unload the modules, it knows
which order works without a kernel Oops.

You have been warned,
