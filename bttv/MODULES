There are quite lot modules out here...

videodev.o
	this is the basic video4linux module, all video
	drivers (incl. bttv) register themself here.

i2c.o
	the generic i2c module. It does much of the i2c bus
	management, all other modules (except videodev.o)
	use this one

	insmod args:
		scan=1		scan the whole bus for i2c devices
		verbose=0	shut up i2c
		i2c_debug=1	for debugging, it sticks the whole
				(software) i2c bus traffic to the
				syslog

bttv.o
	the bt848 (grabber chip) driver

	insmod args:
		remap=adr       remap Bt848 memory to adr<<20		
		vidmem=base	frame buffer address>>20 (of graphic card)
		triton1=0/1     for Triton1 compatibility
                                Triton1 is automatically recognized
                                but this might also help with other chipsets

msp3400.o
	The driver for the msp3400c sound proccesor. If you have a
	stereo card, you probably want to insmod this one.

	insmod args:
		debug=1		print some debug info to the syslog

tuner.o
	The tuner driver.  You need this unless you want to use only
	with a camera or external tuner ...

	insmod args:
		debug=1		print some debug info to the syslog
		type=n		type of the tuner chip. n as follows:
			0: Temic PAL tuner
			1: Philips PAL_I tuner
			2: Philips NTSC tuner
			3: Philips SECAM tuner
			4: no tuner
			5: Philips PAL tuner
			6: Temic NTSC tuner
			7: Temic PAL tuner


You can't load the i2c chip driver modules (tuner,msp3400) with kerneld,
you should modprobe them within a boot script.

NEW: Well, you can't without a kernel patch.  There is a tiny kernel patch
     for 2.0.33.  With the request_module() in bttv.c enabled (you have to
     change a "#if 0" to "#if 1" at the end of bttv.c) and a patched kernel
     loading _all_ the modules on demand works just fine.
