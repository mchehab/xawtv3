This code is *NOT* (yet) supported to be used as library.

In the long run I plan to turn this into a v4l capture library.  But
that isn't finished yet and probably will not for some time.

There is no documentation written for it.  I don't care (yet) about
backward compatibility.  I neither can nor will stop you from using
the code.  But if you do don't complain if I break your applications
with incompatible changes.  You have been warned.

Please don't distribute this code as shared library.  This is just
asking for trouble.
