Audio
=====

If you don't get sound when recording avi movies, double-check the
mixer settings first.  The record source defaults to micro on many
linux sound drivers, you probably have to change this to line-in with
one of the available mixer tools.  Also keep in mind that ALSA has
all mixer controls at 0 (i.e. muted) by default.

/me uses kmix (because it doesn't need much space on the screen).
The inputs where the sound cards record from have a red background
color.  With the right mouse botton you'll get a menu where you can
change the settings.  FreeBSD has a aumix version with X11 GUI in
the ports collection which is very nice too.

Note on stereo:  xanim seems not be able to playback stereo sound
correctly.


Video
=====

xawtv/streamer handle video recording with multiple threads:

 - one thread records video (and does color space conversion
   / compression, maybe this should be separated)
 - one thread records audio (unless you do video only).
 - one thread writes the movie data to the disk.
 - one thread calls sync frequently to make the writeouts more
   smoothly (more smaller chunks instead of few very big ones).


There are buffer fifo's between the recording threads and the disk
writer to avoid recording overruns due to a temporarely busy hard
disk.

If you see messages about a full fifo or about v4l(2) waiting for
free buffers it is very likely that your hard disk is too slow,
especially if you try to record uncompressed video.

bttv 0.7.x allows you to use more than just two video buffers, you can
configure the number at insmod time (gbuffers option).  Using more
buffers (say 4-8 instead of just two which is the default) should help
to reduce the number of dropped frames.

If you want to record quicktime movies install the quicktime4linux
libraries (http://heroines.sourceforge.net/quicktime.php3), then
(re-)build xawtv.  The configure script should find the library
automatically.


Known problems (and workarounds)
================================

streamer/xawtv can't handle floating point frame rates (like 29.97).
Bad luck for now [to be fixed].

The timestamping for the video frames isn't very exact as it does
_not_ come from the v4l(1) driver but is just a gettimeofday() call
after receiving the video frame.  API design bug, needs fixing.
With v4l2 xawtv uses the frame timestamps provided by the driver.


Troubleshooting syncronisation problems
=======================================

If you are recording a movie with xawtv/stremaer you get a display
like this on stderr:

real: 3.638s   audio: 3.529s   video: 3.700s

 - "real" is the real time, i.e. simply the number of seconds passed
   since you've started recording.

 - "audio" says how much audio data was recorded: simply the total
   number of bytes divided by the data rate (bytes/second).

 - "video" is the same for video: total frames divided by the
   frames/second.

Obviously these numbers should stay close together.  If audio and
video run out of sync, you should be able to see whenever audio or
video is wrong by comparing the two with the real time.

The display says how much media data streamer/xawtv tried to put into
the fifos.  Any data which get lost due to fifo overruns will *not* be
taken into accout here, i.e. if you see "fifo full" error messages
your movie will have bad syncronisation even if the display looks
fine.  Possible fixes:  Try using more buffers.  Try recording
compressed video.  Try tuning the hard disk using hdparm.  Buy a
faster hard disk.  Buy a faster computer.

If xawtv/streamer says "queueing frame twice" it has put a the same
video frame twice into the output queue to avoid video running out of
sync.  If this happens alot it indicates that either your computer
can't keep up with compressing the frames or that your v4l device
can't capture frames with the frame rate you are asking for.  A single
message now and then is harmless.


Read/Playback stuff
===================

avi format
----------

 * xanim plays everything without problems.
 * QuickTime[tm] (MacOS) plays the uncompressed formats just
   fine and complains about mjpeg/jpeg.
 * Windows Media Player plays the uncompressed formats fine.
   mjpeg/jpeg work too if a codec is installed (/me has a very
   old one from MainConcept).
 * avifile can't deal with the uncompressed video correctly.
   mjpeg/jpeg doesn't work either for me as it seems not to
   recognise the MainConcept codec, althought I've copied
   stuff to /usr/lib/win32.  Maybe it works with another
   one.
 * MainActor (linux) can read the mjpeg but not the jpeg
   compressed files.


quicktime format
----------------

 * xmovie + broadcast2000 can read the files without problems
   (not exactly surprising as they use the quicktime4linux
   library too ...).
 * QuickTime[tm] (MacOS/Windows) plays them without problems.
 * xanim says it can't find any data in the mov file.  It used
   to work with older versions of the quicktime4linux library
   (before 64bit support was added), so I suspect xanim simply
   can't deal with 64bit mov files.


raw data
--------

 * ImageMagick can deal with this, you have to specify the image
   format + size on the command line like this:
	display -size 320x240 rgb:file.raw
   It can handle multiple frames in one big file too.


Have fun,
