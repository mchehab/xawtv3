'make' should build the whole thing.

vtx2ascii is a simple converter, build out of the videotext sources.
In fact only the main.c is my work, all other C code is just copyed
from the videotext package.  Start it without arguments to get help.

vtx.cgi is a cgi script for converting vtx-pages on-the-fly.  Lynx
approved, with netscape 4 (style sheets required) you'll get colors.
Uses vtx2ascii.  You have to adjust two config lines at the top of
the script.  Usage is very simple, just copy it to your server's
cgi-bin directory and point your browser to it.  If you want, you
can hide it with a Alias like this one:
	ScriptAlias /videotext /home/www/cgi/vtx.cgi	# in srm.conf

vtx.cgi delivers a correct last-modified header (=> cacheable pages)
for fast browsing.  For script hacking you probably want to turn this
off...

vtx.sh is a quite simple terminal browser.  Expects to find vtx2ascii
in $PATH.  Terminal should understand ansi-colors (both linux-console
and xterm do).  Needs more than 25 lines...

Known issues: can't show hidden text, 8-bit chars don't work (wrong
mapping), probably more.  It is'nt tested much, sort of prototype.
