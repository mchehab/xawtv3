bttv + ATI Rage128 + DRI seem not to play nicely together (hard freeze).
Don't know why.  Happens with the ATI only, other gfx cards work fine.
Suspect it's either a hardware problem or a bug somewhere in DRI (either
kernel or xfree86).  The only workaround I know of is to turn off DRI.

For some people xawtv failes with
	Error: Couldn't find per display information

This is probably some library compatibility problem.  I've never seen
this myself.  According to a report I've received upgrading Xfree86 to
4.0 fixed this.  Probaby xawtv does'nt work with 3.3.x libraries if it
was compiled against the 4.0.x versions.

Compiling xawtv without DGA support seems to fix this too.

libXaw3d is buggy.  It bombs when xawtv wants to use a visual with a
different color depth than the default visual.  Looks like this:

bogomips kraxel ~# xawtv
This is xawtv-3.08, running on Linux/i686 (2.2.13)
visual: id=0x22 class=3 (PseudoColor), depth=8
visual: id=0x23 class=1 (GrayScale), depth=8
visual: id=0x24 class=4 (TrueColor), depth=24
switching visual (0x24)

Some people report xawtv segfaults with glibc 2.1
(got success reports too).  I don't know what the
reason for this problem is.  From the stack traces
I've seen so far, I suspect it is a glibc bug or
some incompatibility between glibc and the X11 libs.

I've got one report that upgrading the X11 libs from
3.3.2 to 3.3.3 fixed the problem.


HTH,
