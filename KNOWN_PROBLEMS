Some people report xawtv segfaults with glibc 2.1
(got success reports too).  I don't know what the
reason for this problem is.  From the stack traces
I've seen so far, I suspect it is a glibc bug or
some incompatibility between glibc and the X11 libs.

I've got one report that upgrading the X11 libs from
3.3.2 to 3.3.3 fixed the problem.
