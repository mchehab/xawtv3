2.12 => 2.13
============

  * Fixed Makefile bugs.
  * switched to the new device files:  s|/dev/bttv|/dev/video|
    MAKEDEV in bttv/driver is updated
  * Tried to catch that VidMode problem by version check:
    #define XXX_VERSION (from xf86vmstr.h) against server's QueryVersion
    results.  If this still does'nt work: remember, there is the '-x'
    switch to workaround this...
  * Fast channel scan (Ctrl-Z)


2.11 => 2.12
============

  * added support for 8 bit Servers:  Run the Server with StaticGray
    visual (-cc 0x27 for XFree) -- and you should get a b/w TV picture.
  * fixed a few configure-script and #ifdef bugs
  * modified channel maps again -- hope I got the european map is ok now.
    there is only one map: pal-europe.  This one should work for both
    cable and broadcast.
  * driver changes (capture code -- the SYNC ioctl takes the frame number
    as argument now)


2.10 => 2.11
============

  * bugfix: xawtv used to ignore "fine = ???" in the config file.
  * added grab-one, a small tool to grab single, full-sized images.
    Use the "-h" option for a short description.
  * added channel window (try the 'C' key).
  * Added "zap" mode: does channel hopping (tune in every station a
    few seconds).
  * added fbtv (for framebuffer devices).


2.09 => 2.10
============

  * glibc compile fixes (hopefully, have still libc5...)
  * updated driver to bttv-0.5.8
  * updated applications according to the grabbing changes in the
    bttv driver
  * catched a bug in the config parser (was confused by spaces at
    end-of-line)


2.08 => 2.09
============

  * 15 bit HiColor works now (fixed bttv driver and v4l-conf)
  * renamed some frequency tables to make the names more consistent
    you might have to fix the freqtab= setting in $HOME/.xawtv
    again...
  * Added stereo support to the msp3400 volume mixer.
  * Improved non-overlayed displaying (called grabdisplay in xawtv).
    Not rock-solid yet, driver is'nt stable enouth wrt grabbing.

    BTW: if you get "ioctl VIDIOCMCAPTURE: Try again" on stderr, it
    just means that the bttv driver has no signal (i.e. no station
    tuned in, wrong TV norm, something like that...).

  * the doc subdirectory of the bttv distribution is included now.
  * updated the driver to bttv-0.5.7


2.07 => 2.08
============

  * Ha!  Found a complete (?) frequency table on the web, using this
    one now (and a complete different channel-to-freqency mapping
    method).
    Expect a few new bugs and tuning problems -- pointers to frequency
    lists are welcome.  Check channels.h for details.
    The names of the freqency mappings have changed, you have to
    adopt $HOME/.xawtv

  * fixed a bug in the msp3400 module (system hangs on control
    thread kill)
  * With the 2.1.x modular sound driver, the msp3400 module registers
    as mixer device. This allows to control volume, bass and treble with
    a mixer application of your choice.
  * the config file parser prints more detailed error messages and
    does not exit on errors.
  * Added a workaround for buggy (wrt static gravity) Window managers,
    see manpage (wm-off-by= ...)
  * Started non-overlay displaying (try Shift-ESC). Not completed, not
    stable yet.
  * Changed v4l-conf handling:  It is installed suid-root now and called
    by xawtv.


2.06 => 2.07
============

  * Two hours after releasing 2.06 I noticed that the driver did'nt
    compile with 2.0.33 :-(


2.05 => 2.06
============

  * You can grab both full size and window size now (hold down Ctrl
    for window size).
  * Merged some of the latest vger CVS changes to bttv-0.5.6 to keep
    both versions in sync (at least the ioctl interface). The included
    driver version supports currently both the new
    VIDIOCMCAPTURE+VIDIOCSYNC and old BTTV_GRAB+BTTV_SYNC. xawtv uses
    the new ones.
    The minor numbers for vbi have changed (from 32 to 224)
  * hacked msp3400 stereo handling, it does permanent monitoring now
    and should handle mono/stereo/bilang switches by the TV station
    correctly.


2.04 => 2.05
============

  * Started writing a Changes file
  * fixed a quite stupid getopt bug
  * ditched support for the old-style bttv interface.
  * The screen saver is turned off now in fullscreen mode
  * xawtv can switch video modes now (for fullscreen mode). There is
    a new config file entry for this, check the manpage.
  * fixed configure script (check for c++ only if required)

  * For the bleeding edge people:

    Added some code for the new VIDIOCMCAPTURE and VIDIOCSYNC ioctl's
    (new video4linux code in the vger CVS tree) as compile time
    option.  The configure script should detect the new version and
    use the kernel driver then.

    The ioctl's are'n really new, the are basically slightly modified
    BTTV_GRAB and BTTV_SYNC.  Well, this change breaks _again_ grabbing
    applications, but now there is a standardized interface for
    mmap-based grabbing available.
