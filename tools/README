Some handy tools I've used/wrote for debugging.


dump-mixers
-----------

Just does what the name suggests: It simply dumps the current mixer
settings to stdout.  I used it to debug the msp3400 module, maybe
someone finds this useful...

It scans the devices /dev/mixer[0123]


record
------

records *.wav files in CD quality.  See "record -h" for more info.
Has a input level meter, which might be useful for sound trouble
shooting (check if the mixer settings ok for recording from the
TV card etc.)


propwatch
---------

X11 Property tracker.  If you want to know how to keep track of xawtv's
_XAWTV_STATION property, look at this code.  It has a short man page.


showriff
--------

Display the structure of RIFF files (wav, avi).  Based on some code
published by the german c't magazine some years ago.
