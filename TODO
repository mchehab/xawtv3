TODO list isn't exactly right for this.  It is more a collection of
ideas I'm thinking about.  It *might* mean I have plans to implement
this in near future.

 * frequency= option for .xawtv
 * volume= option for .xawtv
 * videotext decoder (for station ID, maybe subtitles)
 * grayscale avi recording (anybody knows how to do this?  256 color
   with a gray palette?)
 * keep-aspect-ratio option
 * switch to another toolkit, Xaw keyboard/menu support sucks
   (gtk maybe?)
 * use threads (instead of fork()ing off children)
 * mjpeg compression has alot of (partly design) problems, have to think
   about how to handle this in a clever way...
 * config file args for avi-params, numerate movies?
 * grab-v4l: use more than two buffers
 * i18n
