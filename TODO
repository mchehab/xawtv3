TODO list isn't exactly right for this.  It is more a collection of
ideas I'm thinking about.  It *might* mean I have plans to implement
this in near future.


general
=======

 * volume= option for .xawtv (not trivial - to make this a useful feature
   it should be a station-specific offset to the overall volume.  Try to
   get this right for every soundcard / high + low volume / ... ).
 * mono/stereo config file options.
 * videotext decoder (for station ID, maybe subtitles)
 * switch to another toolkit, Xaw keyboard/menu support sucks
   gtk?  Motif?
 * config file args for avi-params?
 * i18n/locale
 * hotkeys/remote commands for mono/stereo/...
 * two (more?) channel lists: "all" & "frequently used".


avi
===

 * grayscale avi recording (anybody knows how to do this?  256 color
   with a gray palette?)
 * OpenDML index support
 * showriff has problems with files > 2 GB.  Not sure if it's me or glibc...
