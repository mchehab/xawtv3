small is beautiful
==================

This is a _simple_ xaw-based TV Program which uses the bttv driver.
Copy Policy is GNU GPL.


compile & install
=================

./configure --with-bttv=../bttv && make
make install

A successful compile may require a "make clean" in the bttv
directory. Tested with bttv 0.4.3. If you have a stereo card,
you'll probably want to patch bttv's TVscreen widget, a diff
is in the patches directory.


usage
=====

Just start it. You'll get a black screen. You can control the Program
with the following keys:

  B		Capture on/off
  T		Sound on/off		(req. configuration see below)
  M		Mouse pointer on/off

  P		PAL
  N		NTSC
  S		SECAM
  up+down	tune up/down one channel
  left+right	finetuning

  ESC,Q,E	Exit

  F5/F6		Bright up/down
  F7/F8		Hue
  F9/F10	Contrast
  F11/F12	Color


You can stick the channels into a config file ($HOME/.xawtv). Looks like this:

	[ORB]
	channel = 27

The branches hold some String (channel name), the lines below the
settings for that channel. Usually the channel line is enouth. Other
options are:

fine = n
  finetuning (what left+right keys do)
  Default: 0

norm = pal | ntsc | secam
  which TV norm, default is pal

key = keysym
  Hotkey for the channel. All X11 keysyms allowed here.

capture = yes | no
  capture on/off

source = tuner | c1 | c2 | svhs
  input source

color = n
  Color, default is 254

bright = n
  Bright, default is 0

hue = n
  Hue, default is 0

contrast = n
  Contrast, default is 216


Anything *before* the first channel is taken as default for all
channels. If you hav'nt PAL, you probably want to stick norm = NTSC
there, so you don't need this line for every channel.

Another global setting (alowed before the first channel) is this:

	mixer = device

This allows to control volume using the sound card mixer. device is
*not* /dev/mixer, but the name of the sound source (line1 for me, just
take one of the mixer programs floating around and try which is the tv
card...).
Volume-control works with the keypad: + is up, - is down, Enter is mute.

The left mouse button will popup a menu with all channels, the right
button has a menu with some of the control functions.

Have fun!
