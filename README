small is beautiful
==================

This is a _simple_ xaw-based TV Program which uses the bttv driver or
video4linux (included in 2.1.7x).  Copy Policy is GNU GPL.


compile & install
=================

There is modified bttv-0.5.6 in the bttv subdirectory.  Only the
driver itself is included.  If you use the bttv for the first time, I
recommend to get the whole bttv package from Ralph's page (see below)
and check out the documentation. Some (very limited) informations can
be found in the bttv/MODULES file.

I merged the latest video4linux changes from the vger CVS tree to the
bttv driver.  This xawtv version does _not_ work (read: the included
binary can't grab and it does'nt compile) with plain bttv-0.5.6, you
need either the included version or the latest video4linux bits from
vger's CVS tree.  Check also the Changes file.


$ ./configure --with-bttv=/path/to/bttv/driver && make

should compile xawtv, radio, maybe kradio and v4l-conf.  If you omit
the --with-bttv option, the driver in the bttv directory will be used.

You can install xawtv, v4l-conf and kradio (as root) with:

# make install


usage
=====

v4l-conf
--------

v4l-conf is a small tool which tells video4linux about the current
video mode (size and color depth).  This requires root priviliges,
becauce it is easy to crash the box by passing bogous values there.
It requires the X-Server up and running.  It is a temporary hack, this
problem probably will be solved in a better way later on (Alan plans
to write a X-Server extention).  Try "v4l-conf -h" for a short
description.

It is installed suid-root now, and xawtv runs it at startup.  Should
work out-of-the-box without extra configuration.


xawtv
-----

There is a man page now, check it out.

xawtv will not work without the app-defaults.  You'll get a error
message about a zero-sized shell widget if the app-defaults are
not correctly installed.

If you want to try xawtv without installing it, type...

	$ XUSERFILESEARCHPATH=./%N.ad
	$ export XUSERFILESEARCHPATH
	$ ./xawtv

...to make sure xawtv finds the application defaults (the Xawtv.ad
file).


set-tv
------

Simple command line tuner.  Reads like xawtv the config file $HOME/.xawtv.
Expects a channel name on the command line.  Assuming you have a station
named [ZDF] in your $HOME/.xawtv file, "set-tv zdf" will tune in the
channel defined there.  That way you can tune in a station to grab
teletext (or whatever) without starting up X11.

It prints some useless messages about video resolution due to the fact that
it shares alot of code with xawtv, maybe I fix this later.


dump-mixers
-----------

Just does what the name suggests:  It simply dumps the current mixer
settings to stdout.


vic
---

The grabber-bttv-0.5.6.cc file is a grabber driver for vic, works with
plain bttv-0.5.6.  Up to 12 fps.

There is newer version, grabber-video4linux.cc.  Requires the included
modified bttv version or a kernel >= 2.1.94.  Handles up to 25 fps.

Both versions are tested only with PAL.  The "large" picture size probably
doest'nt work with NTSC.  

If you plan to compile vic:  It is'nt trivial, you should have some
basic knowledge about C and writing/editing Makefiles.  


radio & kradio
--------------

radio support is still very experimental. If you want to play with it:
* You need a special file for it (/dev/bttv-fm, char dev, major 81,
  minor 64).
* "insmod bttv radio=1"

radio is a quite simple command line radio application.  It just
promps for a (FM) frequency.

kradio is a more comfortable KDE application.  There is a font in the
font subdirectory, it is required for kradio (for a cool LED-Style
display :-).  Make sure the KDEDIR and QTDIR environment variables are
set correctly.  Yes, the volume slider does'nt work yet.
