Starting with version 3.70 xawtv + friends do _not_ read $HOME/.lircrc
any more.

Check the xawtvrc manpage ([eventmap] section) for hints on
configuring lirc support.  There is a default configuration througth,
so lirc should work out-of-the-box.  You have to touch the
$HOME/.xawtv config file only if you don't like my defaults.

Have fun,

  Gerd
