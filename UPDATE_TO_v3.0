Incompatible changes in 3.0
===========================

 * The config file format has changed.  There are three new sections:
   [global], [defaults] and [launch].  Global settings go to the [global] 
   section, the default settings for the channels to [defaults].  Tools
   which should be started from xawtv go to the [launch] section now.
   Check the xawtv man page for more details.

 * The command line options all have one dash only ('-debug').  Thats X11
   style (like '-geometry' and '-font'), I will not switch to GNU style
   options.  xawtv uses the Xt options parser, this has the nice side
   effect that there are X11 ressources now for all options, i.e. you
   can turn them on permantly by adding entries to your .Xdefaults file.
   [ FIXME: add them to the xawtv manpage ]

 * The frequency tables are all renamed.  I've removed the TV norm from
   the name to avoid confusion.  They are now named after regions,
   optionally with "-bcast" or "-cable" appended to indicate if the table
   is for cable TV or for broadcast.

 * set-tv is gone, there is the more powerfull tool v4lctl instead.
   Check the v4lctl man page for details.

 * I've unbundled kradio and moved it (with a improved configure script)
   into another tarball.  It caused compile trouble often becauce it
   requires KDE devel packages and a C++ compiler.  People often hav'nt
   found the '--disable-kradio' switch which fixes these problems :-(
   The ncurses-based radio tool is still included.

This file lists only changes which are not backward-compatible to the
2.x versions.  Check the Changes file for a more complete list.
